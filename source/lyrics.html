Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
Somebody tell me that this can be done
Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
Reach for the very next rung

What can I do when I’m stuck in the middle
Reach for the very next rung
Feeling confused, like my life is a riddle
Reach for the very next rung

I can’t look up cause I’m scared where I’m going
Reach for the very next rung
Can’t look down, it’s a bad fear of falling
Reach for the very next rung

Well my hands are shaking
My arms are aching
My knees are quaking
As I reach for the very next rung

When the farmer comes to town with his wagon broken down
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
If you only look and see I think you will agree
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Well the lawyer hangs around while the butcher cuts a pound
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
While the preacher and the cook go strolling down the brook
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

The Farmer Is The Man, The Farmer Is The Man
Lives on credit till the fall
His clothes are wearing thin, his condition it’s a sin
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Now the Farmer he left town and the place got broken down
The pigweed and the thistle it was rife
But the land in fallow lay, just waiting for the day
When dreams and hands could bring it back to life

Now the banker says he’s broke and the merchants up in smoke
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
It would put ‘em to the test if the farmer took a rest
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Schooldays Over come on then John
Time you were getting those pit boots on
On with the sark and the moleskin trowsers, time you were on your way
Time you were learning the pit man’s job and earning a pit man’s pay

Come on then Jim, time to go
Time you were working on down below
Time to be handling a pick and shovel it’s time you were on your way
Time to be learning the colliers job and earning a colliers pay

Come on then Dai, it’s almost light
Time you were off for the anthracite
The morning mist is on the valley, it’s time you were on your way
Time you were learning a miners job and earning a miners pay

Schooldays Over.

I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
I’m just drifting along with the breeze
I have not a care, got my feet up in the air
Laughing and floating with ease 
I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
I’m just doing whatever I please
Call me a clown, no you cannot hold me down
I’m drifting along with the breeze

No, do not worry friends, I am not crazy
Soaring with my silvery balloons
Apologies will never top nephrology
Oh, look at me, I’m halfway to the moon

I do not fear the stratosphere it’s heaven
I’m swinging with angels in the clouds
I hate that I’ll miss Jeopardy at seven
But a lawn chair lets you sail above the crowds

We stepped out and turned right
Straight into the morning light
Silent rain fell at our feet
And we walked down Empty Streets

All the shops closed and still
In the air the autumn chill
Not a word could we speak
As we walked down Empty Streets

I still see your silken hair
I feel you hold me tight
Will you keep your promise dear
Every day you’ll write 

Five thousand miles from you dear
Boredom laced with sudden fear
And a soldier's life is bleak
And he prays for Empty Streets

Roads of hell, towns of dust
As we stare down from these trucks
Poor men fight while the rich men sleep
And I dream of Empty Streets

Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
Now I wonder, was it noise the old woman couldn’t stand
Or did it bring back memories of some sweet lovers hands

I know that she liked music, she always hummed a tune
Magic in the kitchen By the Light of the Silvery Moon
Moments that get lost in time can come to life again
When music touches hidden thoughts buried deep within

When Grandma wasn’t looking I’d sneak into that room
Spin the chair up good and high and play myself a tune
The low notes were the thunder, the high ones were the rain
Holding down the pedals brought lightning to the plains

Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
No one will remember, nothing to regret 
The storms of music I once made, times I can’t forget

Don’t come to me for answers when this world gets you down 
Me, I’m just a working man, got both feet on the ground 
I measure out what’s needed in this life of mine 
I focus on the details according to design

Let’s talk of saws and hammers how to read the plans 
My life is written in the scars you see on these old hands 
And when you are rebuilding what storms have torn apart 
Rock Bottom is a solid place to start

You see me cutting lumber or driving survey stakes 
I know just what I’m doing, I rarely make mistakes 
That’s cause I made them years ago, way before your time 
You bend some nails, break some bones before you reach your prime

Don’t try to swing your hammer just the way I do 
Find a rhythm all your own deep inside of you 
When it’s time to build a house of your very own 
There’s nothing wrong with starting out down on solid stone

I left Frisco yesterday
I had some good times with my friends
I never let on that I knew
That you and I were at the end
‘Cause I’ve learned too well to pretend
 
I’m comin home to see you one more time
Cause you’re the one who made me cry
I’m comin home to see you one more time
I’m comin’ home to say goodbye
 
The mountains and the coast are clear
I see the lights of Monterey
Oh California my old friend
Let’s not forget those early days
Fore I may never pass this way
 
﻿Now I'm prepared to face the pain
Of leavin' one I loved so true
But we're just strangers once again
And there ain't nothin' we can do
So I'll just say goodbye to you

Watch out for the man   Washin’ pots and pans
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Rockin’ to and fro  Waltz across the floor
Holding my baby so tight
Doin’ what I can,    Like a Louisiana man
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Better pull the shade    as my knees begin to fade
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
Haven’t got a care    Prancin’ in my underwear

I got the bedroom in sight

Life is so complete    It’s a tour de feet

Oh, I remember that song
Uh huh, Oh yeah
Yes, I remember that song
Uh huh, Oh yeah
 
The one about teenage heartache
Wishing on the stars above
A song about staying out too late
Thinking you're in trouble and knowing you're in love
 
The way that they sang together
Strumming those twin guitars
I thought that it would last forever
I saw them on the TV, I heard them in my car
 
Why oh why did you leave me?
Why oh why did you go?
 
I never will forget their voices
Crying like two lovesick birds
Growing up and making choices
The magic of the music - the wisdom of the words

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
I asked a friend, How do you do it
Livin’ day to day, Don’t you get those blues
You got no job and you got no savings
Just an old guitar, and even older shoes
You know what he said?
 
I’d rather dance into the distance
Where the tall trees cry,
When the night winds wail
Then to drag down streets of cold existence
It’s a damn good walk up the old long trail
 
Now don’t you think about the future
Don’t your people say, It’s time to settle down
Get yourself a wife, raise up a family
Get outta that cloud, put your feet on the ground
 
I still can remember, deep in December
Locked in a little red school
With the Snow softly falling, I could hear the calling
Of the wild, what’s the number one rule?
 
We talked all night, shared a bottle
We spoke of dreams he sang some songs
You gotta listen to your own heart, That’s what he told me
Get your compass right and you can’t go wrong

I’m walking the edge of a blacktop highway
Guess nobody feels like slowing down
Got all that I own in a beat up suitcase
When the landlord comes I won’t be round
I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

There’s a girl back home and god, I miss her
I’m thinkin’, It’s time to settle down
Just one good ride and I’ll be with her
Thumb in the air, I’m homeward bound
I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

Let the cold wind comb my hair
Let the people point and stare
Who cares what they’re thinking of
I got her letter just yesterday
Called and said, I’m on my way
Now you’re lookin’ at a man in love

I’m leaving those sleepless nights behind me
I’m leaving the state of mind I’m in
Out where the blues won’t ever find me
Say goodbye and turn around
I’m leaving the Lonely Side of Town

When I was five I found my mother crying by the phone
She said, I’ll be alright you run along
I did what any boy would do, I turned and went outside
And brought her every dandelion that my hands could find
And she said, They look like orchids, so beautiful and bright
If you hold them to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

Diamonds are a girls’ best friend, I heard the TV say
Show how much you care by what you pay
I’d like to show you something that didn’t cost a dime
A shiny stone I found when I was maybe eight or nine
And there’s a million stars a-twinkling, like diamonds in the night
If you hold it to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

Yes, and I hear tell the cost of love is high
But I’m glad to know it’s something you can’t buy

I know that life’s not perfect, there are no guarantees
But every day’s a good day, you’re with me
I’d like to bring you orchids, yes and diamonds too
I guess these dandelions and a shiny stone will do
Our love will last forever and every moment is bright
If we hold them to the sun, and Get The Angle Right

Dust Bowl Joe, No he won’t go, He’s the one that stuck around
Some forgot, most they don’t know, He’s the man that stood his ground
When the dust storms hit, most folks quit
They couldn’t stand that lonesome sound
But Dust Bowl Joe pulled his hat low, Set his teeth and hunkered down
He’s a hero in this town

GI Joe movin’ kinda slow, limping back from World War Two
Scars he’s got, Lord they don’t show, all the hell that he went through
When the first shell hit, the shrapnel bit and nearly tore his leg in two
But GI Joe shifted into low, drove his men to higher ground
He’s a hero in this town

“Whiskey Joe hang your head low”, walk the dark side of life
Step by step, blow by blow, lost a child and his wife
In the face of it, he almost quit, tried to drink this county dry
But Whiskey Joe looked into his soul, Stood to fight another round
He’s a hero in this town

Grandpa Joe what a way to go, We’re burying a real class act
A one line will for a Coupe De Ville, “Plant me in my Cadillac”
‘Cause all that shit, that life will git, rolls off a good man's back
Grandpa Joe, ease him down slow, Here’s a man that’s glory bound
He’s a hero in this town

When I think of apples I think about harvest time
Sweet red apples and a girl with lips like wine
Don’t you know I’m coming back someday

Lord, I smell flowers in the air
When I smell flowers, it takes away a winters care
A little wild-flower said she had to go back north somewhere
Don’t you know I’m coming back someday

Lord, there’s a bluebird on the wing
When I see a bluebird I think it’s ‘bout time for spring
Hey mister bluebird if you see that girl won’t you sing
Don’t you know he’s coming back someday

Lord, I got cornsilk in my hands
When I feel cornsilk I think about summer sand
Hair soft as cornsilk, guess it didn’t go the way I planned
Don’t you know I’m coming back someday

When I’m feeling empty, just a little down and weak 
I know where I am welcome day or night
I walk up to the corner, take my favorite seat
By the second cup of coffee, I will be alright

Doris takes my order and I always get the same
A couple over easy and home fries
She forgets the orange juice but I don’t complain
If I do as well at her age,  Lord I’ll be doing fine

At the corner, going back in time
At the corner, stuck in 1949
Well some folks think it’s strange
That nothing here has changed
But me, I love the corner just the same
Where the world is plain
Before we went insane

Well it looks like Norman Rockwell was in here yesterday
Wonder if he had the apple pie
Don’t suppose it’s homemade, looks good anyway
I’ll take a scoop of ice cream on the side

The radio is playing a song from way back when
Doris, she remembers every line
I know that it sounds crazy, but when she turns her head
To me she looks a bit like Patsy Cline

I saw your face just today
The hometown girl on the front page
There you were In mid air
Friday you’d be center stage

But you’re an apparition, I’m stuck in first position
The dancer and the boy are worlds apart
Why should I be upset, I can do a two step
Give me half a dance to win your heart

Now I don’t need that old TV
I’ve got better things to do
I broke my bank and bought a front row seat
Friday I’ll be watching you

Now the curtain falls
It’s the final bow 
That’s when suddenly you see
The boy next door with roses in hand
“Please come dance tonight with me”

Well, Back  in the day baby back in this swamp
A bad boy, cowboy drifting right along
Lost in the Bayou, Lost in the the blues
Shovel headed, dead-a-headed, breaker of the rules
He pulled in a roadhouse, it was the Devil’s Dream
And Oh, Dennis Hopper met the Cajun Queen

A oh, When you throw them dice
A oh, in the Voodoo rice
A oh, Gonna lose your soul
A oh, to Jolie Laveau
jeter les dés dans le riz vaudou
  égarer l'âme Jolie Laveau

The sweet shady marmalady looked in his eyes
Her chocolate legs make him beg to do the slip and slide
Crazy go the Zydeco a pumping loud and clear
A cocain line, a neon sign a-flashing Ice cold beer
Her age didn’t it matter, Her name was it Jolie 
Oh, Dennis Hopper bet the Cajun Queen

Trouble and darkness it rode by his side
Sold his soul to Jolie for that Easy Ride
He drank up the whisky and cranked up the stakes
Dropped a lot of acid by the Saint Louis gates
Everybody loved him, He made a lot of green
Oh, Dennis Hopper, et le Cajun Reine

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
Here’s to the Rocky Road, The ups and downs
Traveling a better road Through the fields and towns
High on a mountainside Or in the valley below
You’re gonna find a sweeter ride Along the Rocky Road

Lace up your old boots, leave the key on the hook
Sometimes second chances don’t need a second look
Old regrets and memories are bills you just can’t pay
Now someone else can fix that Chevrolet

Follow the music, it’s like drifting in a dream
Wash away your troubles in that flowing stream
Sing with true heart, leave it right out on your sleeve
Rid yourself of all that you don’t need

When the path of least resistance
Gets filled up with foolish pride
Take the road to self fulfilment
It’s right outside, yea it’s right outside

When the last light is fading, and the day is done
The cold hand of winter will hide the warming sun
All good intentions will pave a golden road
It’s not the path you chose so long ago

Hey dog, hey dog, hey diggie, diggie dog
Diggie, diggie dog, hey diggie, diggie dog
Hey dog, hey dog, hey diggie, diggie dog
Diggie, diggie, dog hey dog

When I was a boy I'd run through the woods
Run through the woods, run through the woods
When I was a boy I'd run through the woods
Runnin’ with a little brown dog

When I was a boy I'd fish for my supper
Fish for my supper, fish for my supper
When I was a boy I'd fish for my supper
Share my fishy with a dog

When I was a boy I'd camp in the woods
Camp in the backyard, Camp in the woods
I was a boy I'd camp in the woods
Pup tent, boy and a dog

When I was a boy I'd scratch like the Dickens
Scratch like the Dickens, scratch like the Dickens
When I was a boy I'd scratch like the Dickens
Got my fleas from a dog

One for seven, so they say
Dogs grow old, while the children play
Teacher, teacher long ago
I learned all I need to know from a dog

Now my knees they knock through the woods
Clock through the woods, Tick Tock through the woods
Now my knees they knock through the woods
Knockin’ with a little white dog

Hey up girl let's go to the shelter
Down to the shelter, off to the shelter
Hey up girl let's go to the shelter
Now my doggie got a dog

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
In those hills of Carolina
Tween the Piney and the Blue
Dreams of cities, they will blind you
Should the neon get to you

Chopping wood to make a dollar
Play the radio at night
Mailing off to big Chicago
A Stella guitar can change your life

  Gold will glitter in the city                      
  But Broadway lights don’t shine for me          
  I keep coming back to my home in ol’ Deep Gap
  Carolina’s all I really need

Record man he says you’re something
Come to New York in the spring
All these folks here in the city
Will love to hear you pick and sing

Be it center stage at Newport
Or with presidents and Kings
I’m still longing for my back porch
And the happiness it brings
