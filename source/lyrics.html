Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
Somebody tell me that this can be done
Oh, won’t you help me Climb Up A Ladder
Reach for the very next rung

What can I do when I’m stuck in the middle
Reach for the very next rung
Feeling confused, like my life is a riddle
Reach for the very next rung

I can’t look up cause I’m scared where I’m going
Reach for the very next rung
Can’t look down, it’s a bad fear of falling
Reach for the very next rung

Well my hands are shaking
My arms are aching
My knees are quaking
As I reach for the very next rung

When the farmer comes to town with his wagon broken down
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
If you only look and see I think you will agree
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Well the lawyer hangs around while the butcher cuts a pound
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
While the preacher and the cook go strolling down the brook
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

The Farmer Is The Man, The Farmer Is The Man
Lives on credit till the fall
His clothes are wearing thin, his condition it’s a sin
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Now the Farmer he left town and the place got broken down
The pigweed and the thistle it was rife
But the land in fallow lay, just waiting for the day
When dreams and hands could bring it back to life

Now the banker says he’s broke and the merchants up in smoke
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all
It would put ‘em to the test if the farmer took a rest
The Farmer Is The Man that feeds them all

Schooldays Over come on then John
Time you were getting those pit boots on
On with the sark and the moleskin trowsers, time you were on your way
Time you were learning the pit man’s job and earning a pit man’s pay

Come on then Jim, time to go
Time you were working on down below
Time to be handling a pick and shovel it’s time you were on your way
Time to be learning the colliers job and earning a colliers pay

Come on then Dai, it’s almost light
Time you were off for the anthracite
The morning mist is on the valley, it’s time you were on your way
Time you were learning a miners job and earning a miners pay

Schooldays Over.

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
I’m just drifting along with the breeze
I have not a care, got my feet up in the air
Laughing and floating with ease 
I’m just gliding through life on a tailwind
I’m just doing whatever I please
Call me a clown, no you cannot hold me down
I’m drifting along with the breeze

No, do not worry friends, I am not crazy
Soaring with my silvery balloons
Apologies will never top nephrology
Oh, look at me, I’m halfway to the moon

I do not fear the stratosphere it’s heaven
I’m swinging with angels in the clouds
I hate that I’ll miss Jeopardy at seven
But a lawn chair lets you sail above the crowds

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
We stepped out and turned right
Straight into the morning light
Silent rain fell at our feet
And we walked down Empty Streets

All the shops closed and still
In the air the autumn chill
Not a word could we speak
As we walked down Empty Streets

I still see your silken hair
I feel you hold me tight
Will you keep your promise dear
Every day you’ll write 

Five thousand miles from you dear
Boredom laced with sudden fear
And a soldier's life is bleak
And he prays for Empty Streets

Roads of hell, towns of dust
As we stare down from these trucks
Poor men fight while the rich men sleep
And I dream of Empty Streets

              <pre class="blue-grey-text text-darken-4">
Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
Now I wonder, was it noise the old woman couldn’t stand
Or did it bring back memories of some sweet lovers hands

I know that she liked music, she always hummed a tune
Magic in the kitchen By the Light of the Silvery Moon
Moments that get lost in time can come to life again
When music touches hidden thoughts buried deep within

When Grandma wasn’t looking I’d sneak into that room
Spin the chair up good and high and play myself a tune
The low notes were the thunder, the high ones were the rain
Holding down the pedals brought lightning to the plains

Grandma's Old Piano she never let anyone play
Sat silent in the corner, until they hauled it away
No one will remember, nothing to regret 
The storms of music I once made, times I can’t forget

Don’t come to me for answers when this world gets you down 
Me, I’m just a working man, got both feet on the ground 
I measure out what’s needed in this life of mine 
I focus on the details according to design

Let’s talk of saws and hammers how to read the plans 
My life is written in the scars you see on these old hands 
And when you are rebuilding what storms have torn apart 
Rock Bottom is a solid place to start

You see me cutting lumber or driving survey stakes 
I know just what I’m doing, I rarely make mistakes 
That’s cause I made them years ago, way before your time 
You bend some nails, break some bones before you reach your prime

Don’t try to swing your hammer just the way I do 
Find a rhythm all your own deep inside of you 
When it’s time to build a house of your very own 
There’s nothing wrong with starting out down on solid stone

I left Frisco yesterday
I had some good times with my friends
I never let on that I knew
That you and I were at the end
‘Cause I’ve learned too well to pretend
 
I’m comin home to see you one more time
Cause you’re the one who made me cry
I’m comin home to see you one more time
I’m comin’ home to say goodbye
 
The mountains and the coast are clear
I see the lights of Monterey
Oh California my old friend
Let’s not forget those early days
Fore I may never pass this way
 
﻿Now I'm prepared to face the pain
Of leavin' one I loved so true
But we're just strangers once again
And there ain't nothin' we can do
So I'll just say goodbye to you

Better watch my feet    the dogs are both asleep
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
Careful where I stroll   I be in the water bowl
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Singing from the heart   Now what a place to start
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
Watch out for the man   Washin’ pots and pans
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Rockin’ to and fro  Waltz across the floor
Holding my baby so tight
Doin’ what I can,    Like a Louisiana man
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Better pull the shade    as my knees begin to fade
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
Haven’t got a care    Prancin’ in my underwear
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Rockin’ to and fro  Waltz across the floor
I got the bedroom in sight
Doin’ what I can    Like a Louisiana man
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

If you’re young or old   Exercise your soul
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight
Life is so complete    It’s a tour de feet
Dancin’ in the Kitchen tonight

Oh, I remember that song
Uh huh, Oh yeah
Yes, I remember that song
Uh huh, Oh yeah
 
The one about teenage heartache
Wishing on the stars above
A song about staying out too late
Thinking you're in trouble and knowing you're in love
 
The way that they sang together
Strumming those twin guitars
I thought that it would last forever
I saw them on the TV, I heard them in my car
 
Why oh why did you leave me?
Why oh why did you go?
 
I never will forget their voices
Crying like two lovesick birds
Growing up and making choices
The magic of the music - the wisdom of the words
